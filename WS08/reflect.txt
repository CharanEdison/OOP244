--------------------------------------------------


Starting with the virtual functions-

->It is a member functions which are declared within the base class and are re defined. And can be overridden in the derived class.

Function binding-
---------------- 
It is a process of converting identifiers into addresses. And the compiler binds the function to call 
a function definition using the object type.

There are 2 types of:
1)early binding
2)dynamic dispatch

Early binding Is based on the static type of the object and the dynamic dispatch is based on the dynamic type of the object.


Polymorphic objects:
--------------------

It is an object that can change its dynamic type all around its lifetime.
The static type of polymorphic objects identifies the hierarchy of types to which the object belongs , and the dynamic type of the polymorphic objects identifies the rue for interpreting the bit string in region of memory which are currently allocated to the object.


It static type of its are specified through the following:

1) a pointer declaration
2)a receive by address parameter
3)a receive by reference parameter





Reusability and flexibility:

It reduces size of the code.



And then the pure virtual function, it is the principal component of an abstract class. Pure refers to the lack of any executional details.





->Abstract class is a class that contains or inherit a pure virtual function .
->interface is an abstract base class with no data members.








These are my learnings while doing the workshop and project milestone.
