--------------------------------------------------
 During this workshop I learnt many new things do impliment. I watched the recordings and used the notes from the class to do this part of the workshop.
While doing this workshop I learnt about allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array, and overload functions. I did it with the help of part 1.  The function parameter is called formal parameter
Whereas the argument is called the actual parameter and the values is passed to the function by the caller.

The out parameter is used to retune multiple values.it represents the details that's is passed and which is called back.when a function is called the arguments are passed. Functions are used to perform tasks.

Outputparameter is when multiple values are returned.it  is not allowed to use asynchronous methods
Method overloading can also be done using the out parameters. Whereas an in parameter arguments are by value and the information is passed by the caller to the function.
