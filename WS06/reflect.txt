--------------------------------------------------

While doing this workshop I learned to define and create copy constructor, to define and create copy Assignment, to prevent copying and assignment in a class,overload insertion operator, printing using ostream, over load extraction operator and printing class using stream, to Do a simple file IO using ifstream and ofstream, and by using the c++ string class to extract some unknown characters from the input,

With the help of weekly material and the Wikipedia link (rule of three) I did this workshop,

In the rule of 3 it should define 3 special member functions, it is as follows:
Destructor 
Copy constructor and 
The copy assignment operator 

If we did not declare  one of the special member functions it will implicitly emolument the following semantics.
i)By calling the destructor of all the object class type members,
ii)In copy constructor, it constructs all the object's members from the nearby members of the copy constructor's arguments. By calling the copy constructor of the class type and does a plain assignment of all the non class type data members.
iii)with the copy assignment operator, it assigns all the object's members from the nearby  members of This operator, and calls the copy assignment operators of the object's class-type members and does a plain assignment all the non class type data members.

Deep copies and assignments: in this each will allocate memory for the resource and copy the contents of the source to the destination memory .
There are 2 special memberz= functions that manages the allocation and deallocations associated withe deep copying and  the deep copy assigning, it is as follows:
1)the copy constructor
2)the copy assignment operator

Starting 

With the copy constructor, it creates copies and returns an object by the value from a function. 
Declaration of copy constructor:
---------------------------------
Type(const Type&);


And 
The copy assignment operator, it contains the the logic for copying the data from a previous object to an existing object.

Declaration of copy assignment operator:
----------------------------------------
Type& operator=(const Type&);

Example of class and copy assignment operator
----------------------------------------------
class food {
     int its;
     float* nameoffood;
     int qty;
 public:
     food();
     food(int, const float*, int);
     food(const food&);
     food& operator=(const food&); 
     ~food();
     void display() const;
 };


Overall with this, 
A class with resource requires some custom definition of  copy constructor, copy assignment operator and destructor and initializing pass by value, and return by value client code calls the copy constructor.

Iosstream classa are overloaded the extraction and insertion operators as helper to those of its own class,
The input file object is the instance of an ifstream class,
The output file object is an instance of an ofstream class

These are my learnings of this weeks while doing the lab.
